In Task 1 AI & ML internship, the aim was to clean and pre-process the Titanic dataset for use in machine learning. That includes loading the dataset and seeing the structure of the data (checking for missing data and data types). The missing data was imputed by using the ‘median’ for the numerical and the ‘mode’ for the categorical data. The columns "Sex" and "Embarked" were label encoded. Then "Age" and "Fare" numerical features were standardised by using StandarScaler to guarantee equal scaling among all the features
